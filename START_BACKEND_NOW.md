# START YOUR BACKEND NOW

## The backend is NOT running. That's why you're getting the connection error.

I've stopped the slow Docker container. Now you need to start the backend.

---

## OPTION 1: Start Backend Locally (FASTEST - Recommended)

**Open a NEW terminal window and run these commands:**

```bash
cd "/Users/macbook/Documents/REDDIT BOT"
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload
```

**Wait for this message:**
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8001
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

**Then refresh your browser and login!**

---

## OPTION 2: Wait for Docker (SLOW - 5+ minutes)

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up backend-dev
```

This will take 5+ minutes to install all dependencies.

---

## After Backend Starts

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Login with:
   - **Email:** `admin@example.com`
   - **Password:** `admin123`
3. You should see the dashboard!

## Why This Happened

The Docker container was stuck installing Python packages (very slow on Apple Silicon Macs). Your local Python environment already has everything installed, so it's much faster to run locally.

## Current Status

✅ Login bug fixed
✅ Database ready
✅ Admin user created
✅ Port 8001 freed
❌ Backend not running (YOU NEED TO START IT)

**Start the backend using Option 1 above!**
