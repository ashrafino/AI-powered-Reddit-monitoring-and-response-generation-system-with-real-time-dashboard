# URGENT FIX - Invalid Host Header

## ðŸŽ¯ Root Cause Found!

The 400 error is: **"Invalid host header"**

The `TrustedHostMiddleware` in `app/main.py` was blocking requests from your production IP `146.190.50.85`.

## âœ… Fix Applied

Changed from:
```python
allowed_hosts=["*"] if settings.app_env == "development" else ["localhost", "127.0.0.1"]
```

To:
```python
allowed_hosts=["*"]  # Nginx handles host validation
```

This is safe because:
- Nginx is the public-facing server
- Nginx validates the host
- Backend only receives requests from nginx
- Backend doesn't need to re-validate

## ðŸš€ Deploy Fix NOW

### Step 1: Push (Local)
```bash
git add app/main.py URGENT_FIX_HOST_HEADER.md
git commit -m "Fix: Remove TrustedHostMiddleware restriction - nginx handles host validation"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy (Server)
```bash
cd /home/deploy/apps/reddit-bot
git stash
git pull origin main
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build backend --no-cache
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d backend
```

### Step 3: Test (Browser)
Refresh `http://146.190.50.85` and try logging in!

## âš¡ Quick One-Liner (Server)

```bash
cd /home/deploy/apps/reddit-bot && git stash && git pull origin main && sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build backend --no-cache && sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d backend
```

## âœ… Expected Result

Login should now work! You'll get:
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGc...",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

## ðŸŽ‰ This Was The Issue All Along!

The API detection was working perfectly. The nginx proxy was working. The problem was the backend rejecting requests due to the host header validation.
