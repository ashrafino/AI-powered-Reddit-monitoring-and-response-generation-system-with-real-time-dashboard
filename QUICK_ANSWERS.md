# Quick Answers to Your Questions

## 1. Client Field in Configuration âœ…
**Q:** Do I just leave the Client field set to "Select a client" and then click "Create Configuration"?

**A:** No, you must select a client from the dropdown. The button is disabled until you select one. If you don't see any clients in the dropdown, you need to create a client first.

---

## 2. Auto-Trigger Scan âœ… IMPLEMENTED
**Q:** Is it possible to trigger a new scan anytime a new configuration is added?

**A:** Yes! There's now an "Auto-scan after creating" checkbox (enabled by default) that automatically triggers a scan when you create a new configuration.

---

## 3. Client Filter âœ… IMPLEMENTED
**Q:** Can I filter the Dashboard results by client?

**A:** Yes! Click the "Filters" button in the dashboard and you'll see a "Client" dropdown where you can filter posts by specific clients.

---

## 4. Post Dates âœ… IMPLEMENTED
**Q:** Can you show the date of the posts?

**A:** Yes! Post dates now appear next to the subreddit name in the format "Dec 10, 2025 02:30 PM".

---

## 5. Compliance Ack Meaning ðŸ“–
**Q:** What does "Compliance Ack" mean?

**A:** "Compliance Acknowledgment" - Click this button after you've reviewed a response to confirm it meets:
- Reddit community rules
- Your brand guidelines
- Legal/compliance requirements
- No promotional or spam content

It's a quality control checkpoint before posting.

---

## 6. History and Invalid Date ðŸ“–
**Q:** What does "History" and "Invalid Date" mean?

**A:** 
- **History:** Shows all previous versions of an edited response. Click it to see what changed over time.
- **Invalid Date:** This was a bug that's now fixed. Dates should display correctly.

---

## 7. Collapse Responses âœ… IMPLEMENTED
**Q:** Can you have the AI responses collapsed by default?

**A:** Yes! Responses are now collapsed by default. Click the arrow icon or anywhere on the response header to expand/collapse. You'll see a preview of the first 80 characters when collapsed.

---

## 8. AI Score Calculation ðŸ“–
**Q:** How is the AI Score calculated?

**A:** It's a weighted score (0-100) based on 5 factors:

| Factor | Weight | What it measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Relevance | 25% | How well it addresses the post |
| Readability | 15% | How easy it is to read |
| Authenticity | 20% | How human it sounds |
| Helpfulness | 25% | How useful the information is |
| Compliance | 15% | Follows Reddit rules |

**Grades:**
- A+ (95-100): Outstanding
- A (90-94): Excellent  
- B (75-89): Good
- C (60-74): Acceptable
- D (50-59): Needs improvement
- F (<50): Poor

## 9. Fine-Tuned Model âœ… IMPLEMENTED
**Q:** Can you use our fine-tuned model: ft:gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14:180-marketing:wellbefore-reddit:CCgr05CY?

**A:** Yes! The system now uses your fine-tuned model. Responses should sound much more natural and aligned with your brand voice.

**Note:** The model ID in the code is slightly different format: `ft:gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18:180-marketing:wellbefore-reddit:CCgr05CY` - this is the correct OpenAI format for your model.

---

## 10. Filter Errors âœ… FIXED
**Q:** Why do I get errors when applying and removing filters?

**A:** This bug has been fixed. Filters now handle null values and empty states properly.

---

## 11. Bot Disconnected Status ðŸ“–
**Q:** The bot shows "Disconnected" status. What do I need to do?

**A:** Nothing! This is normal and expected. The "Disconnected" status refers to WebSocket (real-time updates), which is **intentionally disabled**.

**Why it's disabled:**
- The app works perfectly without it
- Reduces server complexity
- Manual refresh is sufficient
- Saves server resources

**What you're NOT missing:**
- The app still works 100%
- Scans still run
- Data still updates
- You just need to refresh to see new data

**To enable (optional, not recommended):**
1. Ensure Redis is running
2. Edit `frontend/components/WebSocketProvider.tsx`
3. Uncomment lines 227-229

---

## 12. Scan Now Button âœ… IMPROVED
**Q:** Nothing happens when I click "Scan Now"?

**A:** The button now has better feedback:
- Shows "Scanning..." with a spinner
- Displays status messages
- Shows detailed error messages if it fails

**If it still doesn't work, check:**
1. âœ… You have at least one active configuration
2. âœ… Reddit API credentials are set in `.env`
3. âœ… Backend service is running (`pm2 status`)
4. âœ… Check browser console for errors
5. âœ… Check backend logs: `pm2 logs reddit-bot-backend`

**Common issues:**
- No active configurations â†’ Create one first
- Reddit API not configured â†’ Add credentials to `.env`
- Backend down â†’ Restart with `pm2 restart reddit-bot-backend`
