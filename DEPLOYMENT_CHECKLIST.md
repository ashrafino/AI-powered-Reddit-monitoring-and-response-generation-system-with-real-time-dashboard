## Troubleshooting Reference

If something goes wrong:

1. **Check logs**: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f`
2. **Check status**: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps`
3. **Restart services**: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart`
4. **Rebuild**: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build`
5. **Check resources**: `docker stats`

## Quick Commands

```bash
# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f

# Restart all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart

# Update application
cd ~/apps/reddit-bot
git pull
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build

# Backup database
~/backup-db.sh

# Check disk space
df -h

# Check memory
free -h
```
