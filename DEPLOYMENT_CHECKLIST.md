## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If Tests Fail

#### OpenAI Model Error
```bash
# Check API key
cat .env | grep OPENAI_API_KEY

# Check logs
pm2 logs reddit-bot-backend | grep -i openai

# Verify model ID in code
grep -r "ft:gpt-4o-mini" app/services/openai_service.py
```
- [ ] API key is correct
- [ ] Model ID is correct
- [ ] API key has access to model

#### Frontend Not Updating
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
cd frontend
rm -rf .next
npm run build
pm2 restart reddit-bot-frontend
```
- [ ] Cache cleared
- [ ] Build successful
- [ ] Service restarted
- [ ] Browser cache cleared

#### Responses Not Collapsing
```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors
cd frontend
npm run type-check

# Rebuild
npm run build
pm2 restart reddit-bot-frontend
```
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Build successful
- [ ] Service restarted

#### Client Filter Not Showing
```bash
# Test API endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/clients
```
- [ ] API returns clients
- [ ] At least one client exists
- [ ] User has permission to see clients

#### Scan Button Not Working
```bash
# Check backend logs
pm2 logs reddit-bot-backend

# Check for active configs
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/configs
```
