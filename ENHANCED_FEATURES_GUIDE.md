ENABLE_QUALITY_SCORING=true
ANALYTICS_RETENTION_DAYS=90
```

### 4. Celery Beat Schedule

Update your Celery beat configuration to include new periodic tasks:

```python
# In celery_app.py or beat configuration
CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE = {
    'scan-reddit': {
        'task': 'app.tasks.reddit_tasks.scan_reddit',
        'schedule': crontab(minute=0),  # Every hour
    },
    'update-metrics': {
        'task': 'app.tasks.reddit_tasks.update_performance_metrics',
        'schedule': crontab(hour=1, minute=0),  # Daily at 1 AM
    },
    'generate-trends': {
        'task': 'app.tasks.reddit_tasks.generate_trend_analysis',
        'schedule': crontab(day_of_week=1, hour=2, minute=0),  # Weekly on Monday
    },
    'cleanup-data': {
        'task': 'app.tasks.reddit_tasks.cleanup_old_data',
