## 📖 Key Concepts Explained

### Compliance Acknowledgment
A quality control checkpoint to confirm responses meet:
- Reddit community rules
- Brand guidelines
- Legal requirements
- No spam/promotional content

**When to use:** Before copying and posting any response

### AI Score (0-100)
Composite score based on 5 weighted factors:
- **Relevance (25%)** - Addresses the post
- **Readability (15%)** - Easy to read
- **Authenticity (20%)** - Sounds human
- **Helpfulness (25%)** - Provides value
- **Compliance (15%)** - Follows rules

**Grades:** A+ (95-100) to F (<50)

### History Feature
Version control for responses. Every edit creates a new version so you can:
- Track changes over time
- Revert to previous versions
- See who edited what

### Bot Status (Disconnected)
The WebSocket connection is **intentionally disabled**. The app works perfectly without it:
- ✅ Scans still run
- ✅ Data still updates
- ✅ Everything functions normally
- 🔄 Just refresh to see new data
